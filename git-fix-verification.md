# Git Fix Verification

## Issue Resolved
Fixed "fatal: bad object main" error in Git repository.

## Root Cause
The repository had a grafted commit (`a25a3ab`) with parent references to non-existent objects:
- Parent 1: `74e2c204ead7d93fbc581a09b8a94d25f797c359` (missing)
- Parent 2: `cd679ed1db2c272310f4023d1aa8b6f13c2c0f96` (missing)

## Solution
1. Created a new root commit (`706f45b`) with the same tree content as the problematic grafted commit
2. Reset the branch to use the new clean commit history
3. Verified Git integrity with `git fsck --full`

## Status
✅ Git commits now work properly
✅ Repository integrity verified
✅ Ready for normal development workflow
