# Git Fix Verification

## Issue Resolved
Fixed "fatal: bad object main" error in Git repository.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue had two components:

### 1. Historical Issue (Previously Fixed)
The repository had a grafted commit (`a25a3ab`) with parent references to non-existent objects:
- Parent 1: `74e2c204ead7d93fbc581a09b8a94d25f797c359` (missing)
- Parent 2: `cd679ed1db2c272310f4023d1aa8b6f13c2c0f96` (missing)

### 2. Missing Local Main Branch (Newly Fixed)
- Remote `origin/main` branch existed at commit `e13585b19a290afbf27d15405b160d29d7e402d1`
- No local `main` branch was present to track the remote
- Git commands referencing "main" failed with "fatal: bad object main" or "unknown revision"

## Complete Solution
1. ✅ Created a new root commit (`706f45b`) with the same tree content as the problematic grafted commit
2. ✅ Reset the branch to use the new clean commit history
3. ✅ **Created local `main` branch tracking `origin/main`**
4. ✅ **Configured proper tracking relationship for main branch**
5. ✅ Verified Git integrity with `git fsck --full`

## Verification Tests
✅ `git rev-parse main` - Returns commit hash successfully  
✅ `git log main` - Shows commit history without errors  
✅ `git show main` - Displays commit details properly  
✅ `git merge-base HEAD main` - Works correctly  
✅ `git commit` operations - No longer fail with "bad object main"  
✅ `git fsck --full` - Repository integrity verified  

## Status
✅ Git commits now work properly  
✅ Repository integrity verified  
✅ Main branch reference fully functional  
✅ Ready for normal development workflow
